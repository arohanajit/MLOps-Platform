# MLOps-Platform

A comprehensive MLOps platform that manages the full lifecycle of machine learning operations:
- Data ingestion and validation
- Feature engineering and storage
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Model serving and monitoring

## Architecture

The platform consists of several pipelines:
- **Data Pipeline**: Handles data ingestion, validation, and transformation
- **Training Pipeline**: Manages model training, hyperparameter tuning, and experiment tracking
- **Serving Pipeline**: Provides real-time predictions and feature serving
- **Observability**: Monitors system health and model performance

## Infrastructure Components

Our MLOps platform uses the following infrastructure components:

### Cloud Resources (AWS)
- EKS (Kubernetes) for orchestration
- S3 for artifact storage
- ECR for container registry
- RDS (PostgreSQL) for metadata storage
- ElastiCache (Redis) for feature store and caching

### Core Platform Components
- **Kafka & Schema Registry**: For data streaming and schema validation
- **Spark (via Kubernetes Operator)**: For distributed data processing
- **MLflow**: For experiment tracking and model registry
- **Airflow**: For workflow orchestration
- **Redis**: For online feature serving
- **PostgreSQL**: For offline storage and metadata

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup âœ“
- Cloud environment provisioning (Kubernetes cluster, networking, IAM)
- Core platform components installation (Kafka, Schema Registry, Spark, databases, MLflow, Airflow)

### Phase 2: Data Pipeline Implementation
- Data producers integration
- Schema validation setup
- Data transformation workflows
- Feature storage implementation

### Phase 3: Model Training Infrastructure
- Experiment tracking configuration
- Hyperparameter tuning setup
- Model registry implementation

### Phase 4: Model Serving
- Online prediction services (RayServe)
- Feature store integration
- API gateway configuration

### Phase 5: Observability
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Performance dashboards
- Alerting system

## Getting Started
