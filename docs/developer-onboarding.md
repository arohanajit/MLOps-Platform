# Developer Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the MLOps Platform project! This guide will help you get started as a new developer on the team.

## Project Overview

The MLOps Platform is a comprehensive solution for managing the full lifecycle of machine learning operations:
- Data ingestion and validation
- Feature engineering and storage
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Model serving and monitoring

The platform is built with a microservices architecture, deployed on Kubernetes, and follows modern MLOps practices.

## Getting Started

### 1. Access and Accounts

- Request access to the GitHub repository from your team lead
- Make sure you have AWS account access (if working with cloud resources)
- Join the project's Slack channel: `#mlops-platform-dev`

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

Follow the [Development Environment Setup Guide](./development-environment.md) to set up your local environment.

### 3. Learn the Git Workflow

Read the [Git Workflow Guide](./git-workflow.md) to understand our branching strategy and contribution process.

### 4. Understand the Architecture

Review the architecture documentation:
- [System Architecture Overview](./architecture-overview.md)
- [Component Interaction Diagrams](./component-diagrams.md)

### 5. Your First Contribution

Start with a simple task:
1. Pick a "good first issue" from the issue tracker
2. Follow the Git workflow to create a branch and make your changes
3. Write and run tests to validate your changes
4. Submit a pull request for review

## Development Standards

### Coding Standards

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Add type hints to function parameters and return values
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Write unit tests for all new functionality

### Testing

- Run tests locally before submitting PRs: `python src/tests/run_all_tests.py`
- Aim for high test coverage for critical components
- Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests as appropriate

### Documentation

- Update documentation when modifying functionality
- Document complex algorithms and design decisions
- Create diagrams for complex workflows

### CI/CD Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
1. Automated tests on all PRs
2. Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
3. Security scanning
4. Automated deployment to development environment
